# SpaceX

The project is implementing using SpaceX API. Was created using MVVM architecture and Alamofire to handler with network layer. It's a simple
app with two views. One using UIKit and another one using SwiftUI. Also there's a couple of unit test against the rocket model and rocket view model  
to match outputs.
